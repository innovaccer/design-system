## üöÄ Get Up and Running

>üí° If your app runs on `Innovaccer UI engine` you don't need following two steps, please see *Using Components* section bellow.

There are two main steps to use a component in your project:
1. Installing component library using npm or yarn.
2. Loading stylesheet.


**Installing component library:**


Run the following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)  to add the component library to your project:

```bash
npm install @innovaccer/design-system
```

**Adding style:**

As this component library is part of a framework-agnostic design system used at Innovaccer the styling is done with CSS using CSS variables for theming and BEM methodology for reusable and modular styling. So it requires you to include CSS in your project by either importing or serving it as a static file. The complete stylesheet is published as part of the component library at path `@innovaccer/design-system/css`.

Import style at your app's root.

```js
import '@innovaccer/design-system/css';
```

**Using design system font:**

The css sets the font family as `'Nunito Sans'` for the body. To add this font in your project you need to load this font. The recommended way to do it is by adding the following google font cdn link to your app's head.

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nunito+Sans:300,300i,400,400i,600,600i,700,700i,800,800i,900,900i&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

```

**Updating Font:**

If you don't add the font described above font family will not be affected by css. However, if you want to update the font family update it via the following css variable.

```css
--font-family
```

**Reset Styles** 

As BEM is used reset.css is not used and no style reset is done.

**Polyfill for IE**

For css variables to work on IE we use a polyfill at runtime to achieve dynamic theming through variables. Please add the following polyfill in your page.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/css-vars-ponyfill@2"></script>
<script>
  cssVars({
    onlyLegacy: true
  });
</script>

```

**Using Components**

Available components along with live code editor and API documentation can be found [here](https://innovaccer.github.io/design-system).
Components can be imported as mentioned below:


```js
{
  ...
  Avatar,
  Backdrop,
  Badge,
  BreadcrumbsWrapper,
