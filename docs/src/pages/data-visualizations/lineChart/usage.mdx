#### Use Maximum Three Categories
Plotting too many lines on the same chart gives a confusing picture and defeats the purpose.

#### Using Secondary Y-Axis
Incase of secondary Y-axis, following guidelines should be followed:
<ul>
    <li> Secondary Y-axis should only be used if the type of values is different </li>
    <li> If the range of both the axes is close to each other, use proportional intervals </li>
</ul>

<b>Note: </b> Secondary Y-axis should be used sparsely as interpreting data to different axes might be confusing and difficult.
