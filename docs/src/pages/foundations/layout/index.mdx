### Spacing

We use 8px as the base unit for our spacial system. The spacing system has been roughly generated by multiplying eight with even numbers.

### Grid

Using a baseline grid creates a consistent rhythm between the components and typography. We use a 12-columns grid.

<br />

#### Types

##### Regular Grid
<br/>
<br/>

<table style={{width: "100%"}}>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th style={{width:"50%",  textAlign: "left"}}>Property</th>
      <th style={{width:"50%",  textAlign: "left"}}>Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr style={{verticalAlign: "top"}}>
      <td>Left padding</td>
      <td>8px</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style={{verticalAlign: "top"}}>
      <td>Right padding</td>
      <td>
          8px
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr style={{verticalAlign: "top"}}>
      <td>Gutter</td>
      <td>16px</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

##### Grid With Margin

For the outermost grid, this component is used. This can
also be nested subsequently if a 16px padding is required
on both sides.

<table style={{width: "100%"}}>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th style={{width:"50%",  textAlign: "left"}}>Property</th>
      <th style={{width:"50%",  textAlign: "left"}}>Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr style={{verticalAlign: "top"}}>
      <td>Left padding</td>
      <td>8 + 8px</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style={{verticalAlign: "top"}}>
      <td>Right padding</td>
      <td>8 + 8px </td>
    </tr>
    <tr style={{verticalAlign: "top"}}>
      <td>Gutter</td>
      <td>16px</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br />

#### Columns

The column includes the padding at the inside, 8 px each side. This way the gutter becomes 16px for adjacent columns.

<br />

#### Components

We use a 8px baseline grid. All UI components including paddings and margins are created in multiples of eight so that everything aligns to the pixel grid.
When text is used within a UI element, set the line-height to be consistent with the baseline grid.

#### Typography

All typography aligns to a 4px baseline grid. This allows for readable line heights at all sizes.

### Spacing Guidelines

#### 2 px Token
Spacing between related elements.

**e.g.** Spacing between heading and subheading.


![Spacing between heading and subheading](./images/2pxtoken.png)
<Caption> Spacing between heading and subheading </Caption>

<br/>
<br/>

#### 4 px Token
Spacing between group of elements.

**e.g.** Spacing between badges, buttons.

![Spacing between buttons](./images/4pxtoken.png)
<Caption> Spacing between buttons </Caption>

<br/>
<br/>

#### 6 px Token
Spacing between multiple element in a component.

**e.g.** Button with icons on left or right.

![Spacing between buttons](./images/6pxtoken.png)
<Caption> Spacing between buttons </Caption>

<br/>
<br/>

#### 8 px Token
Spacing between group of elements.

**e.g.** Spacing within checkbox group, radio group.

![Spacing within checkbox group](./images/8pxtoken.png)
<Caption> Spacing within checkbox group </Caption>

<br/>
<br/>


#### 12 px Token
Spacing within a section.

**e.g.** Spacing between sections within a modal, sections within a form.

![Spacing between sections within a modal](./images/12pxtoken.png)
<Caption> Spacing between sections within a modal </Caption>

<br/>
<br/>


#### 16 px Token
Spacing between different sections

**e.g.** Spacing between cards.

![Spacing between cards](./images/16pxtoken.png)
<Caption> Spacing between card </Caption>
