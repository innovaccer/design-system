### Enabling Figma libraries
<br/>

#### Sign in to Figma
First and foremost, sign in to Figma using your organization account.

#### Getting the library files
Duplicate the files from the Figma community.
1. [Masala Design System - Branding](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1075022843491691382)
	<br/>
    Includes the core colors, logos and the pre-defined color styles.
2. [Masala Design System - Web guidelines](https://www.figma.com/community/file/974368355920553546)
	<br/>
    Includes the components and patterns that can be used to build web products as per the Innovaccer design language.

**Note:** You will not be able to get real-time updates as the duplicate instance of the library is not connected with the main library file available on the community.

#### Publishing the libraries
Publish the duplicated files as libraries in Figma in order to make them available for use in your organization.

### Start designing
#### Foundations
Masala Design System is a set of guidelines, components, and patterns to speed up product design and development. In order to design and build products on top of Innovaccer’s platform, go through the [Foundations](/foundations/principles/) section to get familiar with the design principles, colors, layouts, typography, etc. that are used throughout our products.

#### Components and patterns
For any [component](/components/overview/all-components) or [pattern](/patterns/overview/all-patterns) that you want to use, there is a respective guideline page which includes its overview, types, variants, states, usage guidelines, etc. It is crucial that you get familiar with these when incorporating the components/patterns in your designs.

#### Content
There is a separate section for [voice and tone guidelines](/content/voice-and-tone-guidelines/tabs/voice-and-tone/) which should be referred for concise and consistent copywriting.
