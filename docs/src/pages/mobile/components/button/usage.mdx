Buttons are one of the crucial elements of a user interface. They are used to initiate actions and can have varying importance based on the need.

### Types

<br/>

#### Primary

Primary buttons are used to describe the primary action on the page and hence only 1 primary button is allowed per screen. These types of buttons have the highest level of emphasis.

#### Label Button

Label buttons have low emphasis and are generally used for less important actions. Give label buttons a negative offset equal to the left/right padding of the button to align them with the content they're used with.

### Usage

<br/>

#### Horizontal Arrangement

Buttons should ideally be arranged horizontally whenever possible. In this type of arrangement, make sure that the buttons have equal width & the primary action is on the right side to reinforce the reading gravity.

#### Vertical Arrangement

This type of arrangement is ideal when the label of the button is long and cannot fit in a half-width button. The width of the button here will be calculated in a manner that the button aligns with its parent. 

In case of multiple buttons, place the primary button at the top to follow the common standards.

#### Multiple Label Buttons

While using multiple label buttons in close proximity, make sure to space them properly so that the user can actually differentiate between them.
