Buttons are one of the crucial elements of a user interface. They are used to initiate actions and can have varying importance based on the need.

### Types

<br/>

#### Primary

Primary buttons are used to describe the primary action on the page and hence only 1 primary button is allowed per screen. These types of buttons have the highest level of emphasis.

#### Label button

Label buttons have low emphasis and are generally used for less important actions. Give label buttons a negative offset equal to the left/right padding of the button to align them with the content they're used with.

Icon with label adds additional visual cues in buttons. The icon can either precede the label or succeed it.

### Usage

<br/>

#### Horizontal Arrangement

Buttons should ideally be arranged horizontally whenever possible. In this type of arrangement, make sure that the buttons have equal width & the primary action is on the right side to reinforce the reading gravity.

#### Vertical Arrangement

This type of arrangement is ideal when the label of the button is long and cannot fit in a half-width button. The width of the button here will be calculated in a manner that the button aligns with its parent. 

In case of multiple buttons, place the primary button at the top to follow the common standards.

#### Multiple Label Buttons

While using multiple label buttons in close proximity, make sure to space them properly so that the user can actually differentiate between them.
