Chips are compact interactive elements that allow users to make selections, filter content, or trigger actions. Since they mostly appear in a group, they are compact in size and come to the rescue when regular components are either too overwhelming (e.g. buttons for selection) or too underwhelming (e.g. dropdowns for applied filters).

<br/>

### Types

<br/>

#### Selection Chips

Selection chips are used to let the users select one or many options from a group and the effect is immediate. Do not provide a single option for selection.

For example - applying filters on a page. In that case, as soon as a selection chip is clicked, the filtered results are shown.

<br/>

#### Input Chips

Input chips are used inside inputs to behave as removable entries or tags.

![Input chips](./images/mchips-2.png)

<br/>

#### Action Chips

Action chips are used when there is a group of related actions to perform. These actions are dynamic and contextual to the content.

<br/>
<br/>

### Variants

<br/>

#### With icon on left

Chips can have an optional icon on the left preceding the label.

<br/>

#### With remove button

Selection and input chips can have a remove button on the right of the label to remove them from the view.

### States

Chips have the **default**, **disabled**, and **active** states. In addition to the aforementioned states, the selection chip also has the **selected** and **selected-disabled** states.

#### Chips group

Chips are compact elements and hence are best suitable to be used in groups with the horizontal spacing of `8px` and vertical spacing of `0px` between chips as the tappable area already goes beyond the visible vertical boundaries.

#### Overflow behavior

<br/>

##### Wrapped to next line

Chips in a chip group can wrap to a new row if all the chips need to be visible. However, if there are more than two rows, consider using horizontal scrolling to save the vertical space.

![Chips wrapped to next line](./images/mchips-8.png)

<br/>

##### Scrollable

The chips group can scroll horizontally if the width exceeds the viewport. A linear gradient shows up on the edges to indicate the overflowed chips.

**[Img 2]** Scroll indication in both sides

**[Img 3]** Scroll indication in left

![[Img 1] Scroll indication in right vs [Img 2] Scroll indication in both sides vs [Img 3] Scroll indication in left](./images/mchips-9.png)

<br/>

**Note: It is not recommended to use wrapping and scrolling at the same time.**

<br/>

#### Action chips vs buttons

The number and label of action chips are contextual to the content and appear dynamically as a group of multiple interactive elements, while buttons are expected to appear consistently and with a familiar call to action.

**Note: In the example below, the actions change depending upon the context of the chat, hence depicted by action chips. On the other hand while adding a new reminder, the actions at the bottom are always fixed in terms of number and the label. They are not contextual to the content and hence depicted by buttons.**

**[Right]** Buttons at the bottom

<br/>

#### Selection chips vs radio/checkbox

Selection chips generally provide an immediate response but in forms where there is a space crunch, they can replace radio and checkboxes in order to display all the available options in a compact area.

**Note:In the example below using selection chips instead of radio and checkboxes saves a lot of space.**
