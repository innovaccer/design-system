#### Types

<br />

##### Solid

Solid Badges should be used to highlight important information on the page so that they can be recognized easily.

<Preview name='badge--solid' />

##### Subtle

Subtle Badges should be used when many badges are required to differentiate content. In that case, using solid badges become a bit overwhelming. For example tags in a list.
