Buttons are one of the most crucial elements of a user interface. They are used to initiate actions and indicate what will happen after interacting with them. They can have varying looks basis on the prominence.
<br/>

#### Types
Buttons come in a lot of styles basis on the intent and prominence.

##### Basic button

Basic button is the simplest and the default style of the button. It is used the most across products. It provides a lightweight button style while still maintaining affordability. Use other styles if less or more visual weight is required.

##### Primary button
Primary button is used to draw attention towards the primary action on a page. It is recommneded to have just a single instance of primary button per page. If you think more than one primary action is needed, try to re-evaluate the priority of actions.

##### Alert button
Alert button indicates destructive actions that cannot be undone typically such as delete, discard, etc.

##### Transparent button
Transparent button indicates actions that are less important or less frequent.

##### Expanded button
Expanded button is used when the width of the button needs to match the parent. Use it sparingly as it takes a lot of space and attention.

##### Icon with label button
Icon with label adds additional visual cues in buttons. The icon can either precede the label or succeed it.

**Icon in Left**
<Preview name='icon-left-button' />

**Icon in Right**
<Preview name='icon-right-button' />

##### Icon button
Icon button only uses icons to indicate what the action would be. They come handy when there is a space constraint and the icon meaning is universal i.e. easy to understand such as print, edit, delete, etc.

It is recommneded to show tooltip on hover so as to provide clarity on what the action would be.
