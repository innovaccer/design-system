Chips are compact components that appear in a group. Since they appear in a group, they are compact in size and come to the rescue when regular components are either too overwhelming (e.g. buttons for selection) or too underwhelming (e.g. dropdowns for applied filters).
<br/>

### Types
<br/>

#### Selection chips
Selection chips are used to let the users select one or many options from a group and the effect is immediate. For example - applying filters on a page. In that case, as soon as a filter chip is clicked, the filtered results are shown.

#### Action chips
Action chips are used when there is a group of related actions to perform. These actions are contextual and dynamic. Buttons can't be used in this case as they should be used for persistent and consistent actions only.

#### Input chips
Input chips are used inside inputs to behave as removable entries or tags.

    </tr>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">

      <td>&#60;icon name&#62;</td>
      <td>-</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
      <td>Clear button</td>
      <td>
          <ul>
              <li>True</li>
              <li>False</li>
          </ul>
      </td>
      <td>True</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br/>

### Usage
<br/>

#### Selection chip vs radio/checkbox
Selection chips should be used when an immediate change/result is expected on selection. Radio/checkbox should be used when an explicit action is needed to submit the selection, e.g. in a form.
