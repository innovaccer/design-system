Chips are compact components that appear in a group. Since they appear in a group, they are compact in size and come to the rescue when regular components are either too overwhelming (e.g. buttons for selection) or too underwhelming (e.g. dropdowns for applied filters).

#### Types
<br/>

##### Selection chips
Selection chips are used to let the users select one or many options from a group and the effect is immediate. For example - applying filters on a page. In that case, as soon as a filter chip is clicked, the filtered results are shown.

##### Action chips
Action chips are used when there is a group of related actions to perform. These actions are contextual and dynamic. Buttons can't be used in this case as they should be used for persistent and consistent actions only.

##### Input chips
Input chips are used inside inputs to behave as removable entries or tags.

#### Usage
<br/>

##### Selection chip vs radio/checkbox
Selection chips should be used when an immediate change/result is expected on selection. Radio/checkbox should be used when an explicit action is needed to submit the selection, e.g. in a form.
