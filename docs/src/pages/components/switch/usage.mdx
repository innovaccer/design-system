  </tr>
</table>
<br/>

### Usage

<br/>

#### Switch size

The size of the switch depends on the other components appearing around it. If other components are regular in size, then the regular variant of switch should be used. The same goes for the tiny variant.

#### Switch vs Checkbox

<br/>

<ul>
<li> Tapping a switch is a two-step action: selection and execution. </li>
<li> Whereas checkbox is just a selection of an option(s) and its execution requires another control, usually a button. </li>
</ul>

##### Instant response

The options that require an instant response are best selected using a switch.

##### Multiple choices

Checkboxes are preferred over switches when multiple options are available and the user has to select one or more options from them. Clicking multiple switches one by one and waiting to see results after each click takes extra time.

##### Confirmation

Checkboxes are preferred when an explicit action is required to confirm settings.
