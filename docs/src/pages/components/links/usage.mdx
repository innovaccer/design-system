### Usage
#### Standard vs. Subtle link
##### Standard Link
It is the default link component and comes in the primary color. It is used to draw attention and hence it is not recommended to have many links on a single page.

##### Subtle Link
This is the subtle variant of link and hence uses a lighter color. It is primarily used in the breadcrumb component. Use it sparingly such as times when the default link can be too overwhelming to use (too much primary color on the screen).
