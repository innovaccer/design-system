Time picker is used for selecting/entering value for time input. It can either be a dropdown from where you can select preset time values or a specialized input where the user can enter the time using keyboard.

### Types

<br/>

#### Using Dropdown

<Preview name='patterns-datepicker-date-and-time-picker--date-and-time-picker'/>

#### Using Input

This way users can directly enter the time they want. This method does not limit the time values to specific intervals (15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.). The colon appears itself.

<Preview name='components-timepicker-all--all'/>

### Usage

<br/>

#### Using date and time picker together

As soon as a date or date range is selected, time picker dropdown should be triggered so that users can select the time without any additional click.
