Badges contain short labels that help in 'tagging' entities. The container of a badge is rounded at the corners.

#### Types
<br />

##### Solid

Solid badges are used to highlight important information on the page so that they can be recognized easily. They use solid color to easily pop out in a page.

##### Subtle

Subtle badges are used when a lot of entities on a single page need tagging/labeling. In that case, using solid badges becomes a bit overwhelming e.g. tags in a list. This is why subtle badges use the lightest shade of the colors.
