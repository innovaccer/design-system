# Accessibility Audit: CardSubdued

## Summary
The `CardSubdued` component is a variation of a card with a subdued appearance and optional borders. It's rendered as a `<div>`.

## WCAG 2.2 AA Violations/Gaps
- **Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships (Level A)**:
    - As a layout component, `CardSubdued` itself doesn't have semantic meaning.
- **Success Criterion 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)**:
    - Ensure the subdued background and border colors meet contrast requirements against the main card background.

## Actionable Changes
- [ ] **Semantic Role**: Allow passing a `role` prop.
- [ ] **Contrast Audit**: Verify that the subdued colors meet WCAG AA contrast requirements.
