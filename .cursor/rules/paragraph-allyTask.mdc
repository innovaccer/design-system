# Accessibility Audit: Paragraph

## Summary
The `Paragraph` component renders a `<p>` element for blocks of text. It supports various appearances and colors.

## WCAG 2.2 AA Violations/Gaps
- **Success Criterion 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)**:
    - The `subtle` and `disabled` appearances must meet the 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text.
- **Success Criterion 1.4.8: Visual Presentation (Level AAA)**:
    - While this is a Level AAA criterion, ensuring that line height and spacing are adequate is good practice for Level AA as well.

## Actionable Changes
- [ ] **Contrast Audit**: Verify that all `ParagraphAppearance` and `color` combinations meet WCAG AA contrast requirements.
- [ ] **Typography Review**: Ensure default line-height and paragraph spacing are sufficient for readability.
