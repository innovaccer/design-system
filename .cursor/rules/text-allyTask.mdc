# Accessibility Audit: Text

## Summary
The `Text` component is a basic typography utility that renders a `<span>`. It supports various sizes, weights, and appearances.

## WCAG 2.2 AA Violations/Gaps
- **Success Criterion 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)**:
    - The `subtle` and `disabled` appearances must meet the 4.5:1 contrast ratio.
- **Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships (Level A)**:
    - If `Text` is used to represent a heading or other semantic element, it should use the appropriate HTML tag or ARIA role.

## Actionable Changes
- [ ] **Contrast Audit**: Verify all `TextAppearance` and `color` combinations for contrast compliance.
- [ ] **Polymorphic Component**: Consider allowing the `Text` component to be rendered as different HTML elements (e.g., `strong`, `em`, `div`) using an `as` prop to improve semantics.
