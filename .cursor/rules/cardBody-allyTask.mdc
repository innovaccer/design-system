# Accessibility Audit: CardBody

## Summary
The `CardBody` component is a simple wrapper for content within a `Card`. It's rendered as a `<div>`.

## WCAG 2.2 AA Violations/Gaps
- **Success Criterion 1.3.1: Info and Relationships (Level A)**:
    - As a layout component, `CardBody` itself doesn't have semantic meaning. It should ensure that the content within it is correctly structured.

## Actionable Changes
- [ ] **Semantic Role**: If the body contains a specific type of content (e.g., a list), ensure the appropriate roles are used.
- [ ] **Polymorphic Component**: Consider allowing the `CardBody` to be rendered as different HTML elements (e.g., `section`) using an `as` prop.
